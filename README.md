# My Reads App

React app for listing books that you are interested in.

Built on top of the starter template for the final assessment project for Udacity's React Fundamentals course, developed by [React Training](https://reacttraining.com). 

## :zap: Quickstart

1. Clone the repo
2. cd into the repo and run `npm install`
3. run `npm start`

I you follow those steps the app should open in your favorite browser.

## Important
The backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md). That list of terms are the _only_ terms that will work with the backend, so don't be surprised if your searches for Basket Weaving or Bubble Wrap don't come back with any results.
